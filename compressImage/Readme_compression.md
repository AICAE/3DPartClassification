## Image compression: done in C++
cppyy `imagePreprocessing.py`
image size, for assembly level product like bearing, or complex part like gear

bolt are standard, geometry hashing ()
surface uid + collisionType matrix, can be used to merge in parallel.
surface uid, first bit are solid uid

how to check deadlock

random shake, pixpix
square pixels block, instead of line
image compressing 4, 8X8 (unit64_t -> double/float32 [0, 1] or [-1, 1]),  also avoid pooling
normalized to float32 or float64

G-function, C to accelerate
