Pairwise Recognition
First, we explored four different implementations of our multi-view recognition method, with both greyscale and
depth images as input. We evaluated the performance based on two parameters: the weighting system used in Equation

Multi-view semantic learning network for point cloud based 3D object detection

Review: deep learning on 3D point clouds

Specifically, the Multiple Views Generator (MVG) module in our approach observes the scene from four views by projecting the 3D point cloud to planes with specific angles, which preserves much more low-level features, e.g., texture and edge.

A New Algorithm for 3D Shape Recognition by Means of the 2D Point Distance Histogram

Abstract

A new algorithm for the recognition of three-dimensional objects is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is based on the rendering of several 2D projections of a 3D model, from various positions of the camera. Similarly to the proposition given in [1], the vertices of the dodecahedron enclosing the processed model contain the cameras for this purpose. The obtained projections are stored in bitmaps and the Point Distance Histogram for the description of the planar shapes extracted from them is applied. The obtained histograms represent a 3D model. The experiments performed have confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm. It outperformed five other algorithms for the representation of 3D shapes.
